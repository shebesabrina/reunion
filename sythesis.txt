* You're trying to get us to learn how to use hashes with objects and methods.

* I'm creating a reunion with an instance of the activity. The participants are
stored in a hash with the participant as the key and the value starts off with
the amount "chipped in" when I call the add_participant method. The amount_owed
is based on the total amount "chipped in" divided by the total amount of
participants. The amount_owed is then storing the new amount either as a positive
or negative value. The return_cost iterating over the hash to then return the
new cost per participant (amount_owed).

* The most difficult portion was iterating over the hash because I'm more
comfortable with iterating over arrays so I had to turn the new amount back into
a hash.

* I liked the math, turning the participants into a hash of key/values, and
shoveling in the instance of an activity class into the reunion class.
